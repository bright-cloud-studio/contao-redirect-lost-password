# Bright Cloud Studio's Contao Redirect Lost Password
## Extends the default Contao 'Lost password' front end module to allow forwarding users to a alternative page for setting their new password

This was created as a partner to my "[Contao Redirect Failed Login](https://github.com/bright-cloud-studio/contao-redirect-failed-login)" package. Using that, we set up a "Failed Login" page which contains a login form and a password recovery form. When the user attempts to recover their password, the link in the email they recieve sends them back to our newly set up "Failed Login" page. Instead, we would like to send them to a page dedicated to password recovery, so this package was created.

Although this is a companion package for "[Contao Redirect Failed Login](https://github.com/bright-cloud-studio/contao-redirect-failed-login)", it can safely be used on it's own to achieve the same desired effect.
