# Bright Cloud Studio's Contao Redirect Lost Password
## Extends the default Contao 'Lost password' front end module to allow forwarding users to a alternative page for setting their new password

This package was created as a partner to my "[Contao Redirect Failed Login](https://github.com/bright-cloud-studio/contao-redirect-failed-login)" package. Using that we set up a "Failed Login" page with a login form and a password recovery form. When the user attempts to recover their password the link in the email they recieve sends them back to our newly set up "Failed Login" page. Instead, we would like to send them to a page dedicated to password recovery, so this package was created.
